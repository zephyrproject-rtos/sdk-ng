Subject: [PATCH] qemu: Determinism fixes

When sources are included within debug information, a couple of areas of the
qemu build are not reproducible due to either full buildpaths or timestamps.

Replace the full paths with relative ones. I couldn't figure out how to get
meson to pass relative paths but we can fix that in the script.
